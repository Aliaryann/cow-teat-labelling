## Cow Teat Detection — private local labeling + training pipeline

This repository contains a privacy-first, local pipeline to label images and train a YOLOv8 model for cow teat detection. It intentionally excludes datasets, runs, and models from version control — see `.gitignore`.

Quick contents
- `scripts/` — pipeline helpers (prepare_data.py, full_pipeline.py, fix_labels.py, etc.)
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies to recreate the environment

Recreate the development environment (macOS, zsh)
1. Create and activate a venv:

   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

2. Install dependencies:

   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Launch labelImg (from the venv) to annotate images (if using GUI labeling):

   # If labelImg installs the console script
   venv/bin/labelImg

   # Or run via module (depending on your labelImg install)
   python -m labelImg

How to commit & push this repository safely (high-level)
- Ensure `.gitignore` is present and contains `venv/`, `datasets/`, `models/`, `runs/`, `packages/`.
- Do NOT add or commit any raw images, labels, or large model files.
- Optionally use `scripts/remove_venv_from_git.sh` to remove any accidental venv commits from the index before committing (see `scripts/`).

Recommended workflow to push (replace the remote URL):

1. git add .
2. git commit -m "Initial commit: cow_teat_detection pipeline (no private data)"
3. git branch -M main
4. git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cow-teat-detection.git
5. git push -u origin main

If you need a hand running these commands, run the cleanup script in `scripts/remove_venv_from_git.sh` first (it will not push for you). Then commit and push using your credentials.

Privacy notes
- This repo purposefully excludes private images and labels. Keep your raw datasets and models off remote git services unless you explicitly want them hosted there.
- Back up your datasets to an external drive or encrypted cloud storage before deleting local copies.

If you'd like, I can (a) create a small release tarball of the non-private code, or (b) prepare a tiny GitHub Actions workflow that prevents pushing files over a size limit. Tell me which you'd prefer next.
